# HTTP REST Scripts

## About

These HTTP REST Scripts can be used to execute several Microsoft Energy Data Services APIs and conduct basic smoke testing (CSV ingestion, manifest ingestion, retrieve legal tags, upload schema, verify data load, etc). These scripts are compatible with the VS Code Extension [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client).

[REST Client Settings](https://github.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient#environment-variables) can be set to create environments and saved in [VS Code Settings](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getstarted/settings/).
